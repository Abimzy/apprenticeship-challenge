# Gaslight Apprenticeship Challenge

Welcome to the Gaslight Apprenticeship challenge. Your mission, should you choose to accept
it, is to build a shopping list application using React. This repo is based on [this excellent React book and tutorial](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/introduction/). It should have everything you need to build a basic React application. We highly encourage you, if you are new
to React (which is fine, I am too!) to follow this tutorial and build the example application.

## Getting started

To start, you should make a fork of this repo. As long as you have node and npm installed on your computer, you should be able to do the following:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This should build all the code in the application an start a server listening on port 8080. If you open your browser to http://localhost:8080 you should see this:

This will mean your environment is set up correctly and your ready to start coding!

## The Shopping List

We'd like you go build a basic shopping list application. It should have the following features:

1. **Create a shopping list.**
A shopping list should have a name and list of items.
2. **Edit a shopping list.** A user should be able to change the name of their shopping list.
3. **Add a shopping list item** A user should be able to add items to a shopping list. Each item should have a name, SKU #, and price.
4. **Removing an item** A user should be able to remove an item from a list.

## Criteria

Impress us! We value code that is simple and easy to understand. We don't have any expectations that you have a server portion to this application, but if you're able to get these features implemented and want to stretch yourself/impress us more, where are some things you could try:

### Test your code
If testing isn't something you've seen much of yet, it's one of the first things we'll focus on during your apprenticeship. There's a section in the tutorial we refer to on Testing React. Looking this over and applying it would definitely make you stand out from a crowded field :)

### Store the shopping list
There are options like [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/libraries/react/) that would allow you to persist the shopping list in the cloud. That might be fun!

### Add features
Think of other things a shopping list might need to be it more useful. Let your imagination run wild!

## Submitting the finished application

Once you've built your application, submit a pull request to us. If you are new to using git there are [many](https://try.github.io/) [online](https://git-scm.com/documentation) [resources](http://gitimmersion.com/) for learning git. It will be necessary to have some basic working knowledge of git to complete this challenge, and it is a core skill you'll be using as an apprentice (and as a developer).
