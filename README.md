# Gaslight Apprenticeship Challenge

Welcome to the Gaslight Apprenticeship challenge. Your mission, should you choose to accept
it, is to build a shopping list application using React. This repo is based on [this excellent React book and tutorial](http://survivejs.com/webpack_react/introduction/). It should have everything you need to build a basic React application. We highly encourage you, if you are new
to React (which is fine, I am too!) to follow this tutorial and build the example application.

## Getting started

To start, you should make a fork of this repo. As long as you have node and npm installed on your computer, you should be able to do the following:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

This should build all the code in the application an start a server listening on port 8080. If you open your browser to http://localhost:8080 you should see this:

This will mean your environment is set up correctly and your ready to start coding!

Once you've built your application, submit a pull request to us. If you are new to using git there are many online resources for learning git. It will be necessary to have some basic working knowledge of git to complete this challenge, and it is a core skill you'll be using as an apprentice (and as a developer).

## The Shopping List

We'd like you go build a basic shopping list application. It should have the following features:

1. **Create a shopping list.**
A shopping list should have a name and list of items.
2. **Edit a shopping list.** A user should be able to change the name of their shopping list.
3. **Add a shopping list item** A user should be able to add items to a shopping list. Each item should have a name, SKU #, and price.
4. **Removing an item** A user should be able to remove an item from a list.

## Criteria

Impress us! We value code that is simple and easy to understand.
